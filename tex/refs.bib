 abstract = {I analyze and estimate an extended life cycle model of consumption in which utility depends on the path of consumption and bequests. The theoretical section gives conditions under which consumption and wealth will decline with age. An important determinant is a boundary condition on the consumption path caused by annuities. Using panel data from the Retirement History Survey on the wealth of the retired elderly, I estimate the parameters of the model, which are the degree of mortality risk aversion, the subjective time rate of discount, and the marginal utility of bequests. The estimation method involves solving for the optimal consumption trajectory from the first-order conditions of the dynamic optimization, and from the boundary conditions. The results indicate that the consumption path is sensitive to variations in mortality rates, meaning that mortality risk aversion is moderate, and certainly much smaller than what is typically assumed in the literature. The marginal utility of bequests is small; therefore, desired bequests, which are estimated from model simulations, are small on average. Apparently most bequests are accidental, the result of uncertainty about the date of death. The parameter estimates imply that although consumption and wealth paths may rise at early ages, eventually they will fall as mortality rates become large. Falling wealth with age is confirmed in the raw data: average wealth holdings of the elderly decline with age, and the majority of individuals dissave as they age.},

abstract = {Annuities, long-term care insurance and reverse mortgages remain unpopular to manage longevity, medical and housing price risks after retirement. We analyze low demand using a life-cycle model structurally estimated with a unique stated-preference survey experiment of Canadian households. Low risk aversion, substitution between housing and consumption and low marginal utility when in poor health explain most of the reduced demand. Bequests motives are found to be a luxury good and play a limited role. The remaining disinterest is explained by information frictions and behavioural status-quo biases. We find evidence of strong spousal co-insurance motives motivating LTCI and of responsiveness to bundling with a near doubling of demand for annuities when reverse mortgages can be used to annuitize, instead of consuming home equity.},

abstract = {In many retirement income systems, people forgo a higher stream of public pension income by claiming early. We provide both survey-experimental and quasi-experimental evidence that the timing of public pension claiming is relatively inelastic to changes in financial incentives. Using the survey experiment, we evaluate the effect of two different educational interventions and different ways of framing the decision on the present value of participants' expected pension payments. While all three types of interventions induce delays, these interventions have heterogeneous financial consequences. Educating participants leads to claiming ages with higher pension wealth. In contrast, framing and financial incentives do not improve, and even worsen, financial outcomes. Understanding the impact of various policy tools on expected pension wealth is essential for designing policies to delay claiming.},

 abstract = {Social Security benefits may be commenced at any time between ages 62 and 70.  As individuals who claim later can, on average, expect to receive benefits for a shorter period, an actuarial adjustment is made to the monthly benefit to reflect the age at which benefits are claimed.  In earlier work (Shoven and Slavov, 2012), we investigated the actuarial fairness of this adjustment for individuals with average life expectancy for their cohort.  We found that for current real interest rates, delaying is actuarially advantageous for a large subset of people, particularly for primary earners in married couples.  In this paper, we quantify the degree of actuarial advantage or disadvantage for individuals whose mortality differs from the average.  We find that at real interest rates close to zero, most households - even those with mortality rates that are twice the average - benefit from some delay, at least for the primary earner.  At real interest rates closer to their historical average, however, singles with mortality that is substantially greater than average do not benefit from delay; however, primary earners with high mortality can still improve the present value of the household's benefits through delay.  We also investigate the extent to which the actuarial advantage of delay has grown since the early 1960s, when the choice of when to claim first became available, and we decompose this growth into three effects: (1) the effect of changes in Social Security's rules, (2) the effect of changes in the real interest rate, and (3) the effect of changes in life expectancy.},

abstract = {In 1995, the Social Security Administration started sending out the annual Social Security Statement. It contains information about the worker's estimated benefits at the ages 62, 65, and 70. I use this unique natural experiment to analyze the retirement and claiming decision making. First, I find that, despite the previous availability of information, the Statement has a significant impact on workers' knowledge about their benefits. These findings are consistent with a model where workers need to gather costly information in order to improve their retirement decision. Second, I use this exogenous variation in knowledge to analyze the optimality of workers' decisions. Several findings suggest that workers do not change their retirement behavior: i) Workers do not change their expected age of retirement after receiving the Statement; ii) monthly claiming patterns do not show any change after the introduction of the Social Security Statement; iii) workers do not become more sensitive to Social Security incentives after receiving the Statement. More research is needed to establish whether workers are already behaving optimally, but the information contained in the Statement is not sufficient to improve their retirement behavior.}

Many of these experiments are published in top economics and finance journals. The evidence shows that financial education programs have, on average, positive causal treatment effects on financial knowledge and downstream financial behaviors. Treatment effects are economically meaningful in size, similar to those realized by educational interventions in other domains, and robust to accounting for publication bias in the literature. We also discuss the cost-effectiveness of financial education interventions.}
